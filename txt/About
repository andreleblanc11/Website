I'm a bilingual electrical engineering graduate from l'Universit√© de Moncton with just over a years experience in embedded software development and in electrical engineering practices. I am mostly interested in the telecommunications and micro-electronics field of engineering. During my studies, I took part in multiple commities including the varsity soccer team, the Moncton Blue Eagles, during my 6 years. I'm currently placed in the moncton region and am looking to take part in a couple of personal projects (see projects section).

For my career, I am keen on making a significant impact, primarly in my community and in the field of engineering. I believe that in pushing your limits and in striving for greatness that we become the best versions of ourselves.
