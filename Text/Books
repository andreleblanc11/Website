Jordan Peterson -  12 rules of Life:

For this book, Jordan Peterson talks about the 12 rules of life that he finds most important and that apply to everyday life. His journey started off while answering a Quora question  where a user asked him what are his rules to life. This book is a summary of the 12 most important.

Although somewhat generalized, Jordan Peterson pinpoints a lot of important life lessons which he explains often through biblical stories. A general audience (ages 18+) would be able to read this book and take away a handful of lessons. Personally, what I've taken away the most are the disciplinary tactics implemented by Dr. Peterson and the connection between humans and the bible. I would've liked for it to be a bit longer, but there's already another book for that (12 more rules of life by Jordan Peterson).
